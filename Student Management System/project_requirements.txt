✅ STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM – PLANNING DOCUMENT 

The Student Management System (SMS) aims to streamline and automate the end-to-end management of students, trainers, HR processes, and placements in an academic or training environment. The primary objective is to create a centralized and role-based system where students can track their academic progress and eligibility for placement, trainers can manage student performance, HR can handle interview processes, and the admin can oversee the entire ecosystem with full control.

Key Goals:
✅ Enable secure and role-specific login access for Students, Trainers, HR, and Admin.

✅ Allow students to view real-time academic and placement readiness progress.

✅ Ensure trainers can efficiently manage attendance, assignment completion, and student progress.

✅ Facilitate HR to manage mock interviews, mark technical and HR rounds, and identify placement-eligible students.

✅ Provide admin with full control over user management, course structure, batch creation, and system configuration.

✅ Automate progress calculation using a weighted model to determine placement eligibility.

✅ Implement QR-based attendance tracking for ease and accuracy.
